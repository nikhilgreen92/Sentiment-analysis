# Importing dependencies and renaming the columns.
How to approach:
11. Data cleaning
2. EDA
3. Text preprocessing
4. Model building
5. Evaluation
6. Improvements depending upon Evaluation.
Text preprocessing/Data preprocessing
a) Lower case
b) Tokenisation
c) Removing special characters
d) Removing stop words and punctuations
e) Stemming
# Finding the word cloud for positive and negative reviews i.e. the words that occur most in target column
Applying train_test_split
# Train the classifier
# Evaluate the performance
Now using hyperparameters to better tune data.
